Program to demonstrate Dynamic allocation of c-strings on memory with data abstraction.

This program demonstrates the fundamentals of allocating to heap using malloc() and free().
The functions require instances of string's that contain a valid c-string ('\0').
The program includes three main functions to work on c-strings:
	- Copying c-strings
	- Appending c-strings
	- Truncating c-strings

Compile with: gcc -Wall DynamicCStrings.c -o Dynamic

Execute with: ./Dynamic
